# Development History - Card App Project

## Date: May 19, 2025

### Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Card App (Backend) & Board App (Frontend)
- **Backend Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Frontend Stack**: React, Bootstrap, Styled Components
- **Architecture**: MVC with RESTful API
- **Database**: MongoDB via Docker container (credentials: admin/password)
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for full-stack deployment

### Authentication Features
- JWT-based authentication using OAuth2 principles
- User model with bcrypt password hashing
- Default admin user (username: 'admin', password: 'admin')
- Protected API endpoints requiring authentication
- Role-based authorization (admin role for certain operations)
- Authentication routes for login, registration, and profile access

### Frontend Features
- Responsive UI using React Bootstrap
- Card management interface with create, read, update, delete operations
- Authentication forms for login and registration
- Status indicators for cards (todo, in-progress, done)
- Search functionality for filtering cards
- Pagination for large card collections
- Sample card generation for testing

### Backend Features
- RESTful API endpoints for card management
- MongoDB database connection using Mongoose
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- Admin role verification for sensitive operations
- Error handling and validation

### Containerization
- Docker Compose setup for entire application stack
- Separate containers for MongoDB, backend, and frontend
- Volume mapping for live code changes during development
- Proper networking between containers
- Environment variables for configuration

### Current Development Status
- Fully functional full-stack application
- Containerized deployment with Docker Compose
- Fixed component architecture for proper data flow
- Working CRUD operations with proper authentication

### Recent Fixes
- Resolved issue with delete functionality (404 errors)
- Fixed edit functionality by implementing proper component architecture
- Improved data flow between parent and child components
- Centralized API calls in parent components

## Next Steps

### User Experience Enhancements
- Add loading indicators for all async operations
- Implement toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Improve mobile responsiveness

### Feature Additions
- Add card categories or tags for better organization
- Implement drag-and-drop for changing card status
- Add user profile management
- Implement card assignment to users
- Add due dates and priority levels for cards

### Technical Improvements
- Set up automated testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Create production Docker configuration with optimized builds
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- Add database migrations for schema changes
- Implement logging and monitoring

### Security Enhancements
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add password strength requirements
- Set up secure HTTP headers
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
